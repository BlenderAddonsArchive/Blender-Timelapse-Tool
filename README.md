# Blender Timelapse Tool

Blender Timelapse Tool is an open-source add-on for Blender that allows you to easily create stunning timelapse videos from your 3D animations. It simplifies the process of recording and exporting timelapse sequences, giving you control over speed and output settings.

Although there isn't that many features at this moment, I will continue to add new functionality based on feedback.

## Features

- Record timelapse sequences directly within Blender.
- Choose your desired timelapse speed.
- Export timelapse videos in popular formats.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/aj-phillips/Blender-Timelapse-Tool/releases) page.
2. In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
3. Click the "Install" button and select the downloaded add-on ZIP file.
4. Enable the "Blender Timelapse Tool" add-on.

## Usage

### Select Output Folder

- Click on "Select Output Folder" in the Timelapse Settings panel.
- Choose the directory where you want to save your timelapse.

### Set Timelapse Speed

- Adjust the "Timelapse Speed" slider in the Timelapse Settings panel.
- Specify the speed factor for your timelapse (e.g., 2x, 3x).

### Start Timelapse

- Once you've selected the output folder and set the speed, click "Start Timelapse" in the Timelapse Settings panel.
- The tool will record the timelapse and save it to the chosen directory.

## Versioning Strategy

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is used for versioning in this project. This versioning scheme uses a three-part version number in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Increment for incompatible changes requiring code or configuration modifications.
- **MINOR**: Increment for backward-compatible feature additions or improvements.
- **PATCH**: Increment for backward-compatible bug fixes or minor enhancements.

### Tags

Version numbers are used as tags to mark specific releases in this repository. Each tag corresponds to a stable release of the project. Here's how the version tags work:

- `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`: We use version tags like `v1.0.0` to denote stable releases. These tags indicate that the project reached a stable state at that version.
- `latest`: A `latest` tag will not be used to denote the most recent build. Instead, specific version tags will be used to ensure stability and compatibility.

### How to Use Tags

You can easily access and use specific versions of this project by downloading the corresponding ZIP archive from the [Releases](https://github.com/aj-phillips/Blender-Timelapse-Tool/releases) page. Simply select the version tag you need, download the ZIP, and install it as a Blender addon.
