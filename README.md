# Blender Timelapse Tool

Blender Timelapse Tool is an open-source add-on for Blender that allows you to easily create stunning timelapse videos from your 3D animations. It simplifies the process of recording and exporting timelapse sequences, giving you control over speed and output settings.

Although there isn't that many features at this moment, I will continue to add new functionality based on feedback.

## Features

- Record timelapse sequences directly within Blender.
- Choose your desired timelapse speed.
- Export timelapse videos in popular formats.
